Makefile generates a executable 'sched'. Call to the 'sched' is same as specified in the requirements along with the options.

command to generate executable:
$make

if it says that "make: 'sched' is up to date." then give command:
$make clean
this will remove executable and then you can go ahead to generate the executable file.

The compilation has been successfully tested on courses2.
